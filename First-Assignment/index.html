                    A plan crash, the crew is missing, a lone man waking up in the middle of the forest, cold and in pain, both an indication of a miraculous survival.
                    Snow is covering as far as the eye can lay sight and the sun doesn't seem to be rising soon.
                    The man is "Jonathan Hills", an ex-con from the Mortem Federal Penitentiary, a prison housing some of the most dangerous inmates in the country.

                    Hungry, injured and desperate, faced with such conditions the mind protects itself by invoking memories, providing incentive for the host to ensure its survival,
                    to some it could be days ago, others it's years, nevertheless they both feel the real.

                    Jonathan was a beloved husband, father of two kids and a respected member of the community.
                    Stability, recognition and financial comfort can take years to achieve but seconds to destroy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It happens to everybody, everyday. The husband finishes work early to come home at the sight of his beloved in the arms of another,
                    pure, deep seeded slumbering anger rises, blood boils, vision blurry and the sanity that governs the mind spirals out of control.
                    The man is found covered in blood, with no recollection of what transpired,
                    the court states a momentary lapse of anger has taken place, both kids taken away and left to rot in a cell for 7 years.

                    He could scavenger for items and lights

                    Jonathan made mistakes in the past, this is a trial,
                    He misses his kids, he has to confront his inner demons.
                    His hunger is reminding him of his physical limits and his need

                    Scavenging for items was wise as the hunter grabbed flashlights, food

                    A wild Boar appaeared and slung the survivor in the air. Boars

                    the owner of the cave senses his fear, smells the sweat from

                    The winter is often slumber time for these creatures,
